# Disc Golf Flight Numbers

## Summary

For my final DATA 607, I thought it would be interesting to revisit one of my very first personal data projects and rebuild it, applying what I've learned throughout the semester.

### Introduction to disc golf

Disc golf is sport that has experienced a very interesting growth trajectory in the past couple of decades. Assuming you are familiar with golf, disc golf has a very similar format and scoring mechanic, the main difference being that instead of clubbing golf balls into a hole, players throw flying discs, similar to Frisbees, into a target, usually a metal basket. The modern version of the sport as we know it today has been around for about half a century, and during the COVID-19 pandemic, experienced an explosion in popularity due to its ease of access, affordability, and low contact.

### Flight numbers and their challenges

The games of basketball, tennis, and soccer have had the budget, attention, and lifespan to be thoroughly studied and analyzed, which we sometimes may take for granted. With a very nascent sport such as disc golf, that inherently leans towards a more casual audience, the community is still learning about its own sport.

One of the unique components to disc golf is its namesake; the discs. These discs are built to be thrown much further than your standard Frisbee; elite distance players can throw discs 700+ feet through the air. The physics of these discs is very interesting and surprisingly complex; very small differences in a disc can result in a surprsing change in how the disc flies.

One of the original disc golf manufacturers, Innova, invented a system to help try to categorize discs based on these physical attributes, which they called the Innova Flight Number System. This system categorizes discs by four measures, which are represented numerically on their own disctinct scales.

- **Speed**, which indicates how fast the disc must be thrown in order to fly as the manufacturer intended
- **Glide**, representing how easily the disc is expected to move through the air
- **Turn**, indicating the gyroscopic stability of the disc at high speeds (i.e. how the disc acts when first thrown from the hand)
- **Fade**, which measure the gyroscopic stability of the disc at low speeds (i.e. how the disc acts as it finishes its flight)

While this system has been widely adapted by the community and other manufacturers as a standard, and every disc is expected to have a set of flight numbers, the system is surrounded by myth and folklore, with many in the community simply decrying the entire framework by saying "flight numbers don't matter". A combination of player skill levels, differences in how manufacturers apply the flight number system, and even the plastic polymers that the disc is made from can cause a wide range of outcomes from similarly classified discs.

### Comparing the flight number system to physical disc characteristics

My goal is to take physical measurements of common disc molds and compare them against their advertised flight numbers to see if there is a concrete relationship we can discover between the two.

For flight numbers, I will use the specifications provided by the original disc golf disc manufacturer, Innova, for many of their popular molds.

For the phsyical characteristics, I will use measurements provided by the Professional Disc Golf Association (PDGA), the organization that reviews and approves every disc for professional play.

My goals is not necessarily to predict a set of flight numbers for a given disc, but to instead simply evaluate if there is a measurable relationships between the physical characteristics and their flight numbers.
