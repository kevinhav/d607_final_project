## Abstract

In this paper I consider the flying discs used in the sport of disc golf, specifically exploring the relationship between their physical characteristics and the way manufacturers market and classify these discs - by flight numbers. Using technical specification and manufacturer data, I find strong correlations between the dimensions of a disc's rim to flight numbers, but ultimately conclude that consumers would be best served with a more comprehensive system.

## Introduction to disc golf's current climate

::: {.notes}
- Disc golf is similar to golf, but instead of clubs and balls, we just use discs
- We have the same scoring rules, concepts such as part, etc.
:::

- Disc golf is a relatively new sport that has experienced an explosive growth trajectory in the past couple of decades
- COVID 19 pandemic introduced many people to the sport due to ease of access, affordability, and low contact
- The sudden influx of new players has also brought new questions, and the industry and community have been turning to data driven science to answer them
  
## Why is this interesting?

::: {.notes}
- Disc golf is a sport developing in the same age as modern machine learning
- We have a unique opporunity to see a new sport develop with data and technology to support it readily available
- Very little "conventional wisdom"; we want answers and we want it from data
:::

- We can see new, unique sports science and experimentation emerge and rapidly evolve
- Lots of interesting questions and behaviors in the physics of a discs flight
- Great examples of applied data science solving real problems

## Flight numbers and their challenges {.smaller}

::: {.notes}
- These discs are similar yet different from a Frisbee
- We use ratings similar to how golf clubs are labeled (e.g. 9 iron), but we lack the specifics associated with them such as loft
- (go to simulator) I'd rather show than tell

::: {.fragment}
- **Speed**: how fast the disc must be thrown in order to fly as the manufacturer intended
:::

::: {.fragment}
- **Glide**: how easily the disc is expected to move through the air
:::

::: {.fragment}
- **Turn**: the gyroscopic stability of the disc at *high* speeds (i.e. how the disc acts when first thrown)
:::

::: {.fragment}
- **Fade**: the gyroscopic stability of the disc at *low* speeds (i.e. how the disc acts as it finishes its flight)
:::

## Our objective

::: r-fit-text
Can we use modeling to predict flight numbers based on the shape of a disc?
:::

## Comparing the flight number system to physical disc characteristics

## The data {.smaller}

::: {.notes}
- The PDGA provides disc measurements
- We had to scrape flight numbers from Innova website
- There are other manufacturers but we are focusing just on Innova
:::

```{python}
#| fig-cap: "Data sourced from PDGA and Innova Discs website"
html_table = df.head(10).to_html()
HTML(html_table)
```


## Correlation Matrix

::: {.notes}
- We can see some immediate trends
- Note very high correlations
- Note opposite correlations
:::

```{python}
#| label: fig-corr-plot
#| fig-cap: "Disc correlation "

corr_matrix = make_plots.make_correlation_matrix(df)

make_plots.make_correlation_plot(corr_matrix)
```

## Speed

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{python}
make_plots.make_flight_number_hist(df, 'speed')
```

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{python}
make_plots.make_scatterplot(df, x='speed', y='rim_thickness_(cm)')
```

:::

::::

## Glide

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{python}
make_plots.make_flight_number_hist(df, 'glide')
```

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{python}
make_plots.make_stripplot(df, 'glide', 'speed')

## Conclusion {.smaller}

- Physical characteristics and flight numbers are correlated and predictable, particularly Speed
- Flight *numbers* do not necessarily correspond to flight *patterns*
- Much more data is needed to reliably describe flight patterns
- Other approaches
  - Simulation based (TechDisc)
  - Crowd sourced flight ratings (Infinite Discs)
  - Controlled experiments (StuffMadeHere)
  - Reinforcement learning (Sketches for Humanity)
